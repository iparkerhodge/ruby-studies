# A Practice in Recursion
Simple practices with recursive functions.

#### Recursive Sum
Add all of the numbers in an array.

To test, run `ruby recursive_sum.rb` from the `/recursion` directory.

#### Recursive Flatten
Completely flatten an array with a custom flattening method.

To test, run `ruby recursive_flatten.rb` from the `/recursion` directory.
