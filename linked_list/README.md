# A Singly-Linked List in Ruby
#### Implementation of a Singly-linked list in Ruby
The LinkedList class creates a list of nodes, each with a value and a pointer to the next node. The class contains find, append (to the end of the list), append_after (append a new node after a node matching a target value), and delete methods.

Run the test by cloning the repository and running `ruby linked_list.rb` from within the `/linked_list` directory.
